# Faster-RCNN-Object-Detection-with-Tensorflow-Object-Detection-API  

I had used ssd resnet 50 vpn pre-trained model. I have collected the label dataset which was labelled in LabelImg. I work with labelImg on my anaconda prompt. This blog help me to get into the process https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html 
This github can be helpful for documentation https://github.com/sglvladi/TensorFlowObjectDetectionTutorial
I had also followed Youtuber Krish Naik Video. Here is the Tutorial Link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoMiveY_1Z4&list=PLGFcfL56Hrezy5kbu1QfAqWbpzPk8ROxj&index=2 

I first prepared my dataset and trained the model in first colab. Then exported the saved model, here is the exported models zip link

Then I perform opencv in another colab file. The packages did some issues, that's why I needed to restart the colab for several times. Thank You. Here is the Final output image
